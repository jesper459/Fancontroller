# Fancontroller
Gonna make a Fancrontroller with:
Arduino Trinket Pro 5V and Relaymodule for Arduino.
More will come.

Want it to be able to control:
5-12Volt.
From 0.1 to 0.7Amp or more.
+3Watt per fan.

Would like to add later:
Easy to use interface to configure fan relays.
Physical button for on and off.
Physical button for voltage change (5-7-12V).
Physical Rotary module to change speed.
